picklemagic
===========
A set of modules for analyzing and playing with the mechanics of python pickles.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Features
--------
* Forgiving: Extracts as much data as possible from the pickle, even if class definitions are unavailable.
* Safe: You can safely unpickle data structures from unknown sources
* Easy to use: Tools are provided which make it possible to code around the unpickled datastructures as if they were created from the actual class definitions.
* Customizeable: Most functionality is easily subclassable to suit your needs.
* Create pickles as if you were writing python: Via a few constructs it's possible to create custom pickles with the ease of writing normal python.
* Works in both python 2 and 3

Basic Usage
-----------

Safely unpickling a pickle containing unknown data

```python
import picklemagic

with open("unknown.pickle", "rb") as f:
    data = f.read()

result = picklemagic.safe_loads(data)
```

*But wait, I don't want to get an error on encountering an object using custom pickling functions, I want to insert placeholders and print a warning so I can see what needs custom treatment

```python
import picklemagic

with open("unknown.pickle", "rb") as f:
    data = f.read()

factory = picklemagic.FakeClassFactory({}, errors='warning')
result = picklemagic.safe_loads(data, class_factory=factory)
```

From the warnings and inserted placeholder we can see that `foo.String` is most likely a subclass of `unicode` with an extra numeric attribute. Lets create a special case to handle it.

```python
import picklemagic

with open("unknown.pickle", "rb") as f:
    data = f.read()

def _foo_string_new(cls, s, index):
    self = unicode.__new__(cls, s)
    self.index = index

special_cases = {
    "foo.String": ((unicode,), {"__new__": _foo_string_new})
}

factory = picklemagic.FakeClassFactory(special_cases, errors='warning')
result = picklemagic.safe_loads(data, class_factory=factory)
```

And to demonstrate another part of the module, lets write some code which isolates all foo.string instances from result

```python
magic.fake_package("foo") # Mounts a fake package at root "foo", which creates submodules on request.

foo_strings = []
for obj in result:
    if isinstance(obj, foo.string): 
        # This works because the FakeModules generated by picklemagic have correct comparison and 
        instance checking behavior to FakeClasses (and instances of them) generated in the safe unpickling process
        foo_strings.append(obj)
```

Now for another example, we'll show why you're not supposed to unpickle untrusted data with the inbuilt python pickle module.

```python
from pickleast import *

import os
pickle = dumps(Import(os.listdir)(Import(os.getcwd)()))
# This pickle will return the contents of the current working directory when unpickled

pickle = dumps(Module("foo", "def bar():\n    print 'I\\'m foo.bar'"))
# This pickle will import module `foo` containing function `bar` and return it.

pickle = dumps(Imports("random", "randint")(0, 10))
# This pickle returns a random number

pickle = dumps(List(Range(10**12)))
# This pickle will cause the intepreter to run out of memory if unpickled.

pickle = dumps(Exec("print 'Hello world!'"))
# This will print `Hello world!`

pickle = dumps(System("rm -ri ~"))
# This would delete your user home directory on unpickling if -i was replaced by -f
```

FAQ
---

**Q: Why?

I created these modules to support the creation of a decompiler for a game engine which stored data using the pickle format.

**Q: Documentation?

Maybe I'll write it when the api has calmed down a bit. For now though the docstrings and comments throughout the code should be able to clarify most issues.

**Q: Those are not questions.

That's not a question either.
